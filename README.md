## Overview
Dana's webpage and table are working as intended, but she would like to provide more in-depth analysis options by allowing filtering for multiple criteria at the same time.  Add filters for city, state, country, and shape.

## Results/How-to
Once the page is loaded, navigate to the "Filter Search" box on the left side of the screen. The title is highlighted in the below image.

Simply enter text in the fields you would like to filter, and press tab, enter, or click outside the boxes. Be aware, case matters!

To clear the filters, erase the text you have entered and press enter or, to reset them all, refresh the page.  

## Summary
One drawback of this design is that the fields are case-sensitive. Therefore, one recommendation for further development would be to adjust the code to allow for the user to enter text in different cases.  Another recommendation would be to make it more intuitive to clear the filters, perhaps by adding another button at the bottom of the filter box.
